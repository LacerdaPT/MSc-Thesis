P2P stands for Peak-to-Peak Amplitude calculated as the $\mathop {\mathgroup \symoperators max}_i \left ( \mathop {\mathgroup \symoperators max}_t \left ( JTA_i \right ) - \mathop {\mathgroup \symoperators min}_t \left ( JTA_i \right )\right ), i=0,\dots  , 127$.

(b) The juxtacellular action potentials are overlaid, time-locked to the time of positive peak, with the average spike waveform superimposed in green (n= 442 spikes). (c) Representative extracellular recording that corresponds to the same time window as the recording in panel A. Traces are ordered from upper to lower electrodes and channel numbers are indicated. (d) Extracellular waveforms, aligned on the juxtacellular spike peak, for a single channel (channel 18). (e) the juxtacellular triggered average (JTA) obtained by including an increasing number of juxtacellular events (n as indicated). (f) Spatial distribution of the amplitude for each channelâ€™s extracellular JTA waveform. The peak-to-peak amplitude within a time window (+/- 1 ms) surrounding the juxtacellular event was measured and the indicated color code was used to display and interpolate these amplitudes throughout the probe shaft. (g) The JTAs are spatially arranged. The channel with the highest peak-to-peak JTA (channel 18) is marked with a black (*) and the closest channel (channel 9) is marked with a red (*). }}{3}}
