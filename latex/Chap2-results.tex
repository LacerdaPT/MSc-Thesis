\section{Results}
To be sure about the quality of the juxtacellular recording, auto-correlograms were computed for each recording (Fig. \ref{fig:AC}).
\begin{figure}[!h]

}
\label{fig:AC}
\end{figure}

All the auto-correlograms display a usual distribution, clearly showing a gap in the interval from -5ms to 5ms, assuring that the cell never spiked twice  within a 5ms interval, which conforms with the typical values of refractory period of 2-3ms.

It is worth noting that on the auto-correlogram corresponding to the recording 939 a second peak is resolved around $\tau = -9 ms$ and $\tau = 9 ms$.

For each recording, phy was run with the following parameters:
The data was filtered with a forwards-backwards Butterworth filter of order 3 with cutoff frequency set to 500Hz. The noise standard deviation was evaluated in 50 excerpts of 1 second each. The weak threshold was $\theta_w = 2 \sigma_{noise}$ and the strong threshold was $\theta_s = 4.5 \sigma_{noise}$.

The results are presented in table REFERENCE.

\begin{table}[!h]

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ccccc}
Recording ID & \# detected Spikes & $\sigma_{noise}$ ($\mu V$) & $\theta_W$ ($\mu V$) & $\theta_S$ ($\mu V$) \\ \hline
8213 & 148762 &  12.95 & 25.91 & 58.30 \\ 
936 & 323629 & 10.76 & 21.52 & 48.43 \\ 
939 & 265476 & 10.51 & 21.02 & 47.29 \\ 
945 & 126234 & 10.92 & 21.84 & 49.14 \\

\end{table}

For each detected spike, all electrodes whose corresponding mask value was non-zero were used.

In Fig. \ref{fig:CC} are the whole-probe cross-correlograms for the recordings.

In Appendix NUMBEROFAPPENDIX are the cross-correlograms per channel, where the spike train output by phy was splitted according to the electrode the spike was detected on using the masks.
