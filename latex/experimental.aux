The PS micromanipulator drives the juxtacellular pipette and the IVM manipulator drives the extracellular polytrode. The setup includes a long working distance microscope assembled from optomechanical components mounted on a three-axis motorized stage. The alignment image provides a high-resolution view from above the stereotactic frame, upper left, however a side-view can also be obtained for calibration purposes, upper right (scale bar 100 $\mu m$). (b) Schematic of a coronal view of the craniotomy and durotomies with both probes positioned at the calibration point. The distance between durotomies, such that the probe tips meet at deep layers in cortex, was around 2 mm. The black arrows represent the motion path for both electrodes entering the brain (scale bar 1 mm). (c) Diagram of simultaneous extracellular and juxtacellular paired-recording of the same neuron at a distance of 90 $\mu m$ between the micropipette tip and the closest electrode on the extracellular polytrode (scale bar 100 $\mu m$).}}{2}}
